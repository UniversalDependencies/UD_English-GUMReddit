# Summary

Universal Dependencies syntax annotations from the Reddit portion of the GUM corpus (https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum/) 

# Introduction

**This repository only contains annotations, without the underlying textual data from Reddit**

In order to obtain the underlying text, you will need to use the script `get_text.py`, and either install and set up credentials to use praw/bigquery or use a proxy server to obtain the data from Reddit dumps. For more information on the underlying Reddit text see [this page](https://github.com/amir-zeldes/gum/blob/master/README_reddit.md). For Universal Dependencies annotations of other genres from GUM, see https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-GUM

GUM, the Georgetown University Multilayer corpus, is an open source collection of richly annotated web texts from multiple text types. The corpus is collected and expanded by students as part of the curriculum in the course LING-367 "Computational Corpus Linguistics" at Georgetown University. The selection of text types is meant to represent different communicative purposes, while coming from sources that are readily and openly available (usually Creative Commons licenses), so that new texts can be annotated and published with ease.

The dependencies in the corpus up to GUM version 5 were originally annotated using Stanford Typed Depenencies (de Marneffe & Manning 2013) and converted automatically to UD using DepEdit (https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/depedit/). The rule-based conversion took into account gold entity annotations found in other annotation layers of the GUM corpus (e.g. entity annotations), and has since been corrected manually in native UD. The original conversion script used can found in the GUM build bot code from version 5, available from the (non-UD) GUM repository. Documents from version 6 of GUM onwards were annotated directly in UD, and subsequent manual error correction to all GUM data has also been done directly using the UD guidelines. For more details see the [corpus website](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum/).

# Documents and splits

The training, development and test sets contain truncated, but contiguous pages from Reddit forum discussions, in the order in which they were presented to annotators by the Reddit interface on the date of collection. For more information on thread structure and metadata, see the main GUM (non-UD) repository. Test and dev contain similar amounts of data to the other GUM genre partitions, usually 2,500-3,000 tokens; the rest is assigned to training. For the exact file lists in each split for the Reddit genre see:
